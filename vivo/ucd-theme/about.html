  <h2 id="1">I keep getting “Unable to connect”/ “Problem loading page” when I try to access https://covid-research.experts.library.ucdavis.edu/vivo/.</h2>
  <p>Make sure that you have activated your VPN connection. The registry is available only to campus affiliates. See 
    <a href= "#2">the VPN help entry</a> for details. If the problem persists, contact us at 
    <a href="mailto:experts@ucdavis.edu">experts@library.ucdavis.edu.</a>
  </p>

  <h2 id="2">How do I connect to the campus VPN?</h2>
  <p>Follow the instructions <a href = "https://www.library.ucdavis.edu/service/connect-from-off-campus/">here</a>.</p>
  
  <h2 id="3">How do I edit my registry entry?</h2>
  <p>What you see as your entry is a collection of several data sources. We wanted to 
    make the registry available as soon as possible to enable collaborator discovery, 
    so data editing requires logging into the original data source systems. Check the 
    help items for instructions for editing your <a href= "#10">title</a>, 
    <a href= "#6">publication record</a> and <a href= "#4">keywords</a> on this help page.
  </p>
  
  <h2 id="13">How often do you update the data in the registry?</h2>
  <p>We try to add new users and update the data in the registry from our sources nightly.</p>
  
  <h2 id="4">How to add keywords to my registry entry?</h2>
  <p>Log into <a href = "https://covid-research.experts.library.ucdavis.edu/vivo/">your registry entry</a> using the UCD CAS button. </p>

  <p class="img"><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/covid-research-experts/vivo_login.png" alt="vivo-login"> </p> 
  
  <p>When you log in for the first time, you will be asked for your first and last name and email address. After you receive a 
    message to your email, you will be able to log in and add keywords in the Research Areas section.</p>
  <p class="img"><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/covid-research-experts/vivo_research_areas.png" alt="vivo-research-areas"> </p> 
  
  <p>Click on “Add Concept”.</p>
  <p class="img"><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/covid-research-experts/manage_concept.png" alt="vivo-add-concept"> </p> 
  
  <p>Choose “Select or create a VIVO-defined concept". The other controlled vocabularies are not currently active.</p>
  <p class="img"><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/covid-research-experts/select_vivo_concept.png" alt="vivo-select-concept"> </p> 
  
  <p>Enter a keyword. If your keyword already exists in VIVO as a concept, you will see a drop-down list. You need to click 
    on “Create Concept” to finish.</p>
  <p class="img"><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/covid-research-experts/concept_from_controlled_list.png" alt="vivo-controlled-concept"> </p> 

  <p>If your keyword is not part of a controlled vocabulary, you can also add it within the Research tab of your registry account.</p>

  <h2 id="5">From where are you getting information about my publications?</h2>
  <p>We are using the Publication Management System adopted by the California Digital Library in support of the UC Open Access policy. 
    The sources used are Dimensions, Scopus, Crossref, Web of Science (Lite), Europe PubMed Central, PubMed, eScholarship, arXiv, 
    RePEc, SSRN, DBLP, CiNii EN, CiNii JP, figshare.com (limited) and Google Books.</p>
  
  <h2 id="6">Why are there no publications in my registry entry?</h2>
  <p>There may be two reasons why there are no publications associated with your entry. <a href= "#5">The data source for publications</a> 
    has only been activated for UC Davis faculty. If you are a researcher with a non-faculty appointment, we do not currently have ready 
    data available to add to your entry. You can add publications manually. If you are a faculty member, then most likely you have not 
    claimed your publications in Publication Management System we are using as a data source. Please, refer to <a href= "#7">Only a few 
      of my publications are shown / Many of my publications are missing.</a> to enrich your publication list</p>
  
  <h2 id="7">Only a few of my publications are shown / Many of my publications are missing.</h2>
  <p>It is very likely that you have additional publications in your pending queue. To review your queue, log into your UC Publication 
    Management System <a href = "https://oapolicy.universityofcalifornia.edu/">account</a> and go to your profile.</p>
  <p class="img"><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/covid-research-experts/profile_elementa.png" alt="elements-profile"></p>
  
  <p>Click on the “Publications” tab</p>
  <p class="img"><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/covid-research-experts/element_publications.png" alt="elements-publications"></p>
  <p>Select “Manage Publications”</p>
  <p></p>
  <p class="img"><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/covid-research-experts/element_manage_pubs.png" alt="elements-manage-publications"></p>
  <p>Click on “Pending”</p>
  <p class="img"><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/covid-research-experts/elements_pending.png" alt="elements-pending"></p>
  
  <p>There are several elements in the pending queue that can improve your publication list. First, you can inspect each listed 
    publication and claim the correct ones one by one.</p>
  <p class="img"><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/covid-research-experts/claim_pubs.png" alt="elements-claim"></p>
  
  <p>Second, you can <a href= "#8">improve the search for your publications</a></p>
  
  <h2 id="8">How do I improve the search results for my publications?</h2>
  <p>To improve the search criteria for your publications, log into your UC Publication Management System 
    <a href = "https://oapolicy.universityofcalifornia.edu/">account</a> and go to your profile. If you are already 
    looking at your pending publication list, jump <a href="#14">here</a>. Otherwise, follow the instructions directly below.</p>
  
  <p class="img"><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/covid-research-experts/profile_elementa.png" alt="elements-profile"></p>
  
  <p>Click on the “Publications” tab</p>
  <p class="img"><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/covid-research-experts/element_publications.png" alt="elements-publications"></p>
  <p>Select “Manage Publications”</p>
  <p></p>
  <p class="img"><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/covid-research-experts/element_manage_pubs.png" alt="elements-manage-publications"></p>
  <p>Click on “Pending”</p>
  <p class="img"><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/covid-research-experts/elements_pending.png" alt="elements-pending"></p>
  
  <p id="14">The quickest way to refine your search  criteria is to inspect proposed external id’s such as Scopus, Researcher 
    ID from Web of Science, Dimensions, ORCID id and others. If you claim your id's, you can set the system to automatically 
    claim publications associated with those id's.</p>
  <p>Please, note that your registry entry will reflect changes to your publication list only after the next update.</p>
  <p class="img"><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/covid-research-experts/pub_ids.png" alt="elements-publisher-ids"></p>
  
  <h2 id="9">How do I hide a publication?</h2>
  <p>Log into your UC Publication Management System <a href = "https://oapolicy.universityofcalifornia.edu/">account</a>. 
    Navigate to “Manage Publications”. Each claimed publication has an icon that looks like an eye that will hide it from public view.</p>
  <p class="img"><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/covid-research-experts/invisible_pub.png" alt="elements-hide"></p>
  
  <h2 id="10">How do I change my name/ title?</h2>
  <p>Log into your <a href = https://covid-research.experts.library.ucdavis.edu/vivo/>registry account</a>. You will be able to 
    add your preferred title and add positions. If your registry has been pre-populated with titles and positions, those were 
    obtained from the <a href = "https://oapolicy.universityofcalifornia.edu/">Publication Management System</a> if you are 
    faculty or from <a href = "https://adminit.ucdavis.edu/tech-tips/change-campus-directory">the campus directory listing</a> 
    if you are a non-faculty researcher. You will not be able to edit pre-populated data directly, rather you need to update 
    the original data sources. The changes will be reflected in the researcher registry at the next update, which we will 
    attempt to do nightly.</p>
